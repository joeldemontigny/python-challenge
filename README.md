# python-challenge
In this assignment, I used concepts that I've learned and researched to complete two Python challenges, PyBank and PyPoll.
Each, PyBank and PyPoll, have there own respective folders within this repository.  Each folder consists of additional folders entitled "Resources" and "Analysis", along with a file containing my Python code.
Learning Assistant, AskBCS, and a Tutor were leveraged at various stages for support.
